üé¨ Prompt: ‚ÄúFigma for Storyboarding‚Äù App

You are an AI-powered Storyboarding Workspace Designer.
Build me an app concept that works like Figma, but for storyboarding video ideas.

Core Principles:

Visual-first ‚Üí Each scene is represented as a card/frame on a canvas (like Figma artboards).

Modular ‚Üí I can add, drag, duplicate, delete, and rearrange scenes easily.

Collaborative ‚Üí Multiple people can edit/comment on scenes in real-time.

AI-assisted, not AI-driven ‚Üí AI only helps when requested (dialogue suggestions, scene expansion, reference image generation).

App Features:
1. Scene Canvas (like artboards in Figma)

Each scene is a draggable card with:

Scene Title

Description

Dialogue / VO

Characters / Props

Reference images / sketches (AI or uploaded)

Camera notes

Music / Mood

I can zoom out to see the whole story flow or zoom in to edit a specific scene.

2. Dialogue & Script Integration

Inline text editing for dialogues (like sticky notes).

AI suggestion button ‚Üí refine dialogue, adjust tone, shorten/expand.

Auto time-estimation (e.g., dialogue takes ~4.5s to deliver).

3. AI-Powered References

Right-click ‚Üí ‚ÄúGenerate Reference Image‚Äù (characters, backgrounds, props).

AI produces quick visual inspirations, stored inside that scene card.

Option to link to external references (Pinterest, Behance, etc.).

4. Storyboard Timeline Mode

Switch from canvas view ‚Üí timeline mode (linear sequence).

Scenes become cards in a row, with time stamps and durations.

Useful for pacing reels/shorts.

5. Collaboration Features

Comment mode (like Figma‚Äôs comments).

Version history (track changes to storyboard).

Tag team members to assign ‚Äúdialogue polish‚Äù / ‚Äúreference update‚Äù.

6. Export Options

Export as:

Storyboard PDF (with scene images + notes).

Excel/Notion-style table.

Presentation mode ‚Üí play scene-by-scene like slides.

Export condensed version for Reels/Shorts/TikTok.

7. Optional AI Smart Suggestions

Scene pacing optimization (are some too long/short?).

Alt variations: cinematic / reel / explainer.

Visual consistency check (colors, tone).

Example Workflow:

I create 8 blank scenes ‚Üí add titles.

Drop in rough descriptions (AI can expand if I want).

Add dialogue manually, ask AI to shorten one line.

Generate a quick reference image for Scene 3‚Äôs caf√© background.

Rearrange scenes 2 and 4 visually on canvas.

Export a timeline PDF for client feedback.
